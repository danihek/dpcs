# dpcs - dependency check search

I created this script to have quicker access to source code of libraries that I use (wlroots, wayland etc) to lookup for **something**

Currently it's working only for C libraries with pkg-config.

## Dependecies:
- fzf
- bat
- pkg-config
- git (optional)
- some text editor, works best with **vim** and **nvim**

## Usage:

Run ``dpcs`` in your project directory.
